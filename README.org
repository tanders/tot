* Torsten's Opusmodus Tools (TOT)

This library provides a collection of definitions that extend the algorithmic composition system [[http://opusmodus.com/][Opusmodus]]. 

Note that these tools have been developed for personal use for specific projects, and therefore their generality (or even applicability) for other projects might be limited :)  

Nevertheless, I trust at least some of the various function here might be useful for others. Note that I always tried to document their purpose and limitations and included many usage examples. 


* Documentation

  You can browse the documentation of this library online at https://tanders.github.io/tot/. However, remember that you can directly evaluate the many examples in the documentation when (after installing the library) you drag the library folder into your Opusmodus project navigator and open the documentation within Opusmodus.



* Installation
  
  The instructions below use git for the installation. Even though it is a bit more involved at first, it allows for convenient updates later, and you can even contribute to the development. 

  Install [[https://git-scm.com][git]] (if you have not done already). Also, you should register at [[https://github.com][GitHub]].
    
  Download the present software with git into a directory where [[https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/][ASDF]] can find the software, e.g., [[https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf/Quick-start-summary.html#Quick-start-summary][~/common-lisp/]]. For example, on UNIX incl. OS X you can enter the following commands at the command line (after you created the directory =~/common-lisp/=). Note that =$= is the terminal prompt here, you do not need to enter that :)

#+begin_src bash :tangle yes
$ cd ~/common-lisp
$ git clone https://github.com/tanders/tot.git
#+end_src

  You might be be asked for your GitHub username and password.
  
  This library depends on several other libraries, which you should install in the same way.
  
#+begin_src bash :tangle yes
$ cd ~/common-lisp
$ git clone https://github.com/tanders/string-tools.git
$ git clone https://github.com/tanders/ta-utilities.git
$ git clone https://github.com/tanders/fenv.git
$ git clone https://github.com/tanders/cluster-engine.git 
$ git clone https://github.com/tanders/cluster-rules.git
#+end_src


** Updating your software

   If there are [[https://github.com/tanders/tot/commits/master][changes]], you can update your software later at the terminal in the following way. 

#+begin_src bash :tangle yes
$ cd ~/common-lisp/tot
$ git pull
#+end_src

   Make sure you update all the dependencies likewise.

#+begin_src bash :tangle yes
$ cd ~/common-lisp/string-tools
$ git pull
$ cd ~/common-lisp/ta-utilities
$ git pull
$ cd ~/common-lisp/fenv
$ git pull
$ cd ~/common-lisp/cluster-engine
$ git pull
$ cd ~/common-lisp/cluster-rules
$ git pull
#+end_src



* Usage 

  This library is an [[https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/][ASDF]] system (ASDF is the de facto standard for building Common Lisp software), and you can load it into your Lisp compiler as follows. All dependency libraries are loaded automatically as well. 
   
#+begin_src lisp :tangle yes
(require :tot)
#+end_src  

  For most convenient use within Opusmodus, you can drag and drop the whole folder of this library in the browser of an Opusmodus project. Then, visit the HTML documentation of this library from within Opusmodus: open the =tot=, and then its =doc= folder and click on an HTML file, say =index.html=. You can now browse the reference documentation of the library, which explains its individual definitions. Most importantly, you can directly run all example code in the documentation from within Opusmodus (thanks, Janusz Podrazik).
    
  This collection of definitions is roughly sorted in the file structure and documentation according to certain musical aspects.  

  The file =score= deserves a special mention, because it defines a little library in his own. It provides a collection of tools to transform polyphonic scores in various ways.

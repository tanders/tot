;;; Using cldoc (https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/cldoc/cldoc/) 
;;; Just works.  Minor doc string formatting supported.
;;; Perhaps only downside: internal and exported symbols are not distinguished. Workaround: mark auxiliary function names etc. with a leading underscore (e.g., _aux-function). 
;;; BUG: Nested functions (e.g.g, global functions within flet) not documented. Could this be fixed with cldoc::define-descriptor-handler?

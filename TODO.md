## TODO

  Generalise functions operating only on a flat input list using span (e.g., simplify-dynamics)
  Actually, span only works for nested lists of a single parameter. A better solution would be to support nested arbitrary OMN expressions


## TODO

 - Port interpolation functions from Openmusic
 - Generalise them to support fenvs as interpolation trajectories
 - Use this, e.g., for rhythmic interpolation (intermediate states)
 - Remember that interpolation trajectories do not all need to move into same direction
 - Possibly simplify/quantise results
 - Consider further transformations, e.g., by introducing durational accents etc.
 -> When applying this approach to rhythmic material running parallel in time I can create rhythmic textures, e.g., for string orchestra

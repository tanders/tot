Coding conventions
- In any code you write, only use definitions you know exist. For example, you can use any 
   - Definition build into Common Lisp (e.g., build-in functions, methods, classes, symbols and so
     on documented at HyperSpec)
   - Definitions fromm widely used Lisp libraries (e.g., Alexandria)
   - Opusmodus definitions
   - Anything defined in the current repository or files added to your chat
- Do not use any hypothetical definitions
